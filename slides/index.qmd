## Quiz

::: box-tip
Suppose you have a treatment that you suspect may alter performance on a certain task. You compare the means of your control and experimental groups (say 20 subjects in each sample). Further, suppose you use a simple independent means t-test and your result is signiﬁcant (t = 2.7, d.f. = 18, p = 0.01).

1.  You have absolutely disproved the null hypothesis (that is, there is no difference between the population means).

2.  You have found the probability of the null hypothesis being true.

3.  You have absolutely proved your experimental hypothesis (that there is a difference between the population means).

4.  You can deduce the probability of the experimental hypothesis being true.

5.  You know, if you decide to reject the null hypothesis, the probability that you are making the wrong decision.

6.  You have a reliable experimental ﬁnding in the sense that if, hypothetically, the experiment were repeated a great number of times, you would obtain a signiﬁcant result on 99% of occasions.

## The 'null ritual'

::: box-note
@gigerenzer2004, @gigerenzer2004a, @gigerenzer2018.

1.  Set up a statistical null hypothesis of "no mean difference" or "zero correlation." Don't specify the predictions of your research hypothesis or of any alternative substantive hypotheses.

2.  Use 5% as a convention for rejecting the null. If signiﬁcant, accept your research hypothesis. Report the result as p \< 0.05, p \< 0.01, or p \< 0.001 (whichever comes next to the obtained p-value).

3.  Always perform this procedure.

## Frequentist statistics

::: box-note
-   *P*-values: $P(d|H)$, probability of the difference $d$ (or a more extreme one) given the hypothesis $H$.

-   Neyman-Pearson NHST:

    -   $H$ is the "null hypothesis", to be rejected.

    -   $\alpha$ level: $p \ge \alpha$ non-significant difference, $p < \alpha$ significant difference.

    -   $\beta$ level: statistical power, probability of detecting a significant difference when there is one.

-   Null Ritual [@gigerenzer2004; @gigerenzer2004a; @gigerenzer2018]:

    -   $H$ is a "nil hypothesis": $d = 0$, to be rejected.

    -   $\alpha = 0.05$

    -   $\beta = 0.8$

## Statistical power

::: box-tip
-   Statistical power ($\beta$ level) is affected by sample size.

-   One must determine the sample size needed to achieve the desired statistical power. In Null Ritualistic statistics this is 0.8 (or 80% power).

-   Prospective power analysis.

-   Accuracy in a lexical decision task to investigate shallow morphological representation in L2 speakers.
