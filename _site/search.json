    "text": "Quiz\n\nSuppose you have a treatment that you suspect may alter performance on a certain task. You compare the means of your control and experimental groups (say 20 subjects in each sample). Further, suppose you use a simple independent means t-test and your result is signiﬁcant (t = 2.7, d.f. = 18, p = 0.01).\n\nYou have absolutely disproved the null hypothesis (that is, there is no difference between the population means).\nYou have found the probability of the null hypothesis being true.\nYou have absolutely proved your experimental hypothesis (that there is a difference between the population means).\nYou can deduce the probability of the experimental hypothesis being true.\nYou know, if you decide to reject the null hypothesis, the probability that you are making the wrong decision.\nYou have a reliable experimental ﬁnding in the sense that if, hypothetically, the experiment were repeated a great number of times, you would obtain a signiﬁcant result on 99% of occasions."

These deﬁne a rejection region for each hypothesis.\nIf the data falls into the rejection region of H1, accept H2; otherwise accept H1. Note that accepting a hypothesis does not mean that you believe in it, but only that you act as if it were true.\nThe usefulness of the procedure is limited among others to situations where you have a disjunction of hypotheses (e.g., either \\(\\mu_1 = 8\\) or \\(\\mu_2 = 10\\) is true) and where you can make meaningful cost-beneﬁt trade-offs for choosing alpha and beta.\n\n(Gigerenzer 2004: 590–1)"
