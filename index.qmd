| **Description** | In this workshop we will go through bad statistical practices that are common even among experienced researchers and how to avoid them. In particular, we will talk about the “null ritual”, which is a invalid approach to frequentist statistics commonly used in research. Most of the content of the workshop will be drawn from Gigerenzer’s [Mindless Statistics](https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.socec.2004.09.033) paper. |
| **Prerequisites** | Some familiarity with frequentist statistics is useful but not necessary. This workshop is thought for both beginners and experienced researchers or students, whether they normally use quantitative, qualitative or mixed methods. |
