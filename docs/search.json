In particular, we will talk about the ‚Äúnull ritual‚Äù, which is a invalid approach to frequentist statistics commonly used in research. Most of the content of the workshop will be drawn from Gigerenzer‚Äôs Mindless Statistics paper.\n\n\nPrerequisites\nSome familiarity with frequentist statistics is useful but not necessary. This workshop is thought for both beginners and experienced researchers or students, whether they normally use quantitative, qualitative or mixed methods."

    "text": "Quiz\n\nSuppose you have a treatment that you suspect may alter performance on a certain task. You compare the means of your control and experimental groups (say 20 subjects in each sample). Further, suppose you use a simple independent means t-test and your result is signiÔ¨Åcant (t = 2.7, d.f. = 18, p = 0.01).\n\nYou have absolutely disproved the null hypothesis (that is, there is no difference between the population means).\nYou have found the probability of the null hypothesis being true.\nYou have absolutely proved your experimental hypothesis (that there is a difference between the population means).\nYou can deduce the probability of the experimental hypothesis being true.\nYou know, if you decide to reject the null hypothesis, the probability that you are making the wrong decision.\nYou have a reliable experimental Ô¨Ånding in the sense that if, hypothetically, the experiment were repeated a great number of times, you would obtain a signiÔ¨Åcant result on 99% of occasions."
